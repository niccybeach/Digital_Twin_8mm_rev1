# 8mm beads Digital Twin

This repository aims to show the code that was used in one of the iterations of the digital twin for my MRN412 research project.
The project deals with Digital Twins for granular material processes and the code in this repository was used in conjuction with the simulation software MFiX and Microsoft Power Automate to make the Digital Twin for 8mm plastic beads that were run through the hopper
during the experimental phase of the research project.
